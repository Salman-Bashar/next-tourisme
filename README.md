### Tour-Is-More

A tourism realted platform for travel enthusiastics of Bangladesh.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I have also used [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS framework and [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) for storing data.

## Getting Started

First, install all the required dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
